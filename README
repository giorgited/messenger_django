Steps to start the project:

1. clone the repo
2. cd into the project 
3. If not already install python3, django, channels (pip install python3; pip install django; pip install channels;)
    - installing channels will require you to have C++ build tools. download from here http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools
4. $source myvenv/bin/activate (linux), 
    if on windows -- open CMD (wont work in PS) cd into PROJ, 
         $virtualenv myv
         $./myv/Scripts/activate.bat
5. $python manage.py migrate (migrate the db)
6. $python manage.py runserver (start the server and project) 
7. go to localhost:8000


//to run email smtp in debugger mode run:
    $python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025

    
Possible issues:
1. File "manage.py", line 17, in <module>
    "Couldn't import Django. Are you sure it's installed and "
ImportError: Couldn't import Django. Are you sure it's installed and available on your PYTHONPATH environment variable? Did you forget to activate a virtual environment?

   You either dont have django installed, or more likely you arent in (myvenv)
   re run step #4
2. project starts but its throwing errors regarding DB and sqlite
  -- most likely you have not migrated properly, rerun step#5
