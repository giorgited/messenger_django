Steps to start the project:

1. clone the repo
2. cd into the project 
3. If not already install python3, django 
4. $source myvenv/bin/activate
5. $python manage.py migrate (migrate the db)
6. $python manage.py runserver (start the server and project) 
7. go to localhost:8000

Possible issues:
1. File "manage.py", line 17, in <module>
    "Couldn't import Django. Are you sure it's installed and "
ImportError: Couldn't import Django. Are you sure it's installed and available on your PYTHONPATH environment variable? Did you forget to activate a virtual environment?

   You either dont have django installed, or more likely you arent in (myvenv)
   re run step #4
2. project starts but its throwing errors regarding DB and sqlite
  -- most likely you have not migrated properly, rerun step#5
